Project Overview
This Stopwatch project in C#, designed as a console application, offers a significant opportunity to enhance your programming skills. While a console-based stopwatch may seem simple, it serves as a foundational project for strengthening your understanding of core C# concepts and building practical applications.

Importance for Skill Development
1. Foundational C# Concepts:
Control Flow: Master control flow structures like loops and conditional statements to manage user input and application behavior.
Data Types: Practice working with data types and variables as you handle time-related calculations.
2. Console User Interface (UI) Design:
User Input Handling: Learn to capture and process user input from the console, improving your interaction design skills.
Output Formatting: Enhance your ability to format and display information effectively within a console environment.
3. Algorithmic Thinking:
Time Calculations: Develop algorithms for accurate timekeeping, including elapsed time calculations and display formatting.
Event Handling: Implement event-driven programming to respond to user actions, such as starting, stopping, and resetting the stopwatch.
4. Debugging and Troubleshooting:
Console Logging: Utilize console output for debugging purposes, as console applications lack graphical interfaces.
Error Handling: Implement basic error handling to make your application more robust.
5. Project Structure and Organization:
Modular Design: Practice breaking down your application into functions or methods, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
Code Structure: Learn to organize your code logically within a console application setting.
6. Version Control:
Git Basics: Gain experience with version control by using Git to track changes, making collaboration and project management more efficient.
